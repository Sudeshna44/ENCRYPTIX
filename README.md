The primary objective of this task is to develop a predictive model that can identify customers who are at risk of churning. By analyzing historical customer data, including usage behavior, transaction history, customer demographics, and interactions with the service, the model aims to predict whether a customer is likely to churn in the near future.

Approach:

Data Preprocessing:

Handling Missing Values, Encoding Categorical Variables, Feature Scaling

Feature Engineering:

Customer Tenure, Usage-to-Billing Ratio, Complaints Ratio

Model Building:

Classification Algorithms, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting

Training and Hyperparameter Tuning:

Training the models on the training set.

Optimizing model performance through hyperparameter tuning using techniques like GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV.

Evaluating models based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

Model Evaluation

Customer Churn Prediction using machine learning algorithms provides businesses with valuable insights into customer behavior and allows them to take proactive steps to retain customers. By accurately forecasting churn, businesses can save on acquisition costs, improve customer satisfaction, and ultimately increase revenue. The model's predictions enable businesses to tailor their retention strategies and interventions, ensuring a better customer experience and long-term loyalty.
