The primary objective of this task is to develop a model that automatically identifies and flags incoming SMS messages as spam or legitimate based on their textual content. By analyzing the language patterns and characteristics of the messages, the model aims to accurately classify them into the appropriate category.

Approach:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the text data by converting to lowercase, removing punctuation, and handling special characters, Tokenization, Removing Stopwords, Stemming/Lemmatization

Feature Engineering: Using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) or Word Embeddings, TF-IDF, Word Embeddings

Model Building: Classifiers: Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM)

Training and Evaluation:

Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.

Training the model on the training set.

Evaluating the model's performance on the testing set using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Model Selection

Spam SMS Detection using machine learning and NLP techniques offers a valuable solution to the pervasive issue of unwanted messages. By accurately classifying SMS messages, this model contributes to improving user experience, privacy, and security in mobile communication. The model's ability to quickly identify and filter out spam messages enhances the efficiency and convenience of managing SMS communications for users.
