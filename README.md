The primary goal of this task is to develop a model that can automatically analyze and categorize movie plot summaries into predefined genres. By analyzing the language and context of the plot summary, the model aims to assign one or more genres to each movie, such as Action, Drama, Comedy, Thriller, Sci-Fi, Romance, and more.

Approach:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the text data by converting to lowercase, removing punctuation, and handling special characters, Tokenization, Removing Stopwords, Stemming/Lemmatization

Feature Engineering: Using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) or Word Embeddings, TF-IDF, Word Embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe)

Model Building: Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Training and Evaluation

Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets

Training the model on the training set

Evaluating the model's performance on the testing set using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

Model Selection

Movie Genre Classification using machine learning and NLP techniques enables automation and efficiency in analyzing large volumes of movie plot summaries. By accurately predicting genres, this model contributes to improving user experience in movie platforms, content discovery, and understanding the underlying patterns in movie storytelling.
